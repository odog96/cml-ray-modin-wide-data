# Modin in CML

### Scale your pandas workflow by changing a single line of code

Modin uses Ray, Dask or Unidist to provide an effortless way to speed up your pandas notebooks, scripts, and libraries. Unlike other distributed DataFrame libraries, Modin provides seamless integration and compatibility with existing pandas code. Even using the DataFrame constructor is identical.
